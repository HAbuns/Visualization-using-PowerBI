# E-commerce Data Visualization Project

## Introduction

In this project, I have collected data from an e-commerce company to visualize it into two dashboards: **E-commerce Dashboard** and **Trending Dashboard**. These dashboards provide insights into business operations, product trends, and consumer behavior.

## Project Contents

- **E-commerce Dashboard**: 
  - Visualizes overall revenue, order volume, and key performance indicators for the e-commerce company.
  - Provides detailed insights into best-selling products and customer demographics.

  - Helps the business stay updated on market trends to adjust its strategy accordingly.
